# capture-the-ether-cryptography
Solutions to [Public Key](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/accounts/public-key/) and [Account Takeover](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/accounts/account-takeover/) challenges from Capture the Ether using elliptic curve math.

To run both challenges:
```
python capture_the_ether.py
```

Sources used for defining elliptic curve primitives:
* [secp256k1 Python](https://onyb.gitbook.io/secp256k1-python/)
* [mod_sqrt](https://gist.github.com/nakov/60d62bdf4067ea72b7832ce9f71ae079)
